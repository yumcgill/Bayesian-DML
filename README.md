The R code provided is to implement the Example 1 for “A scalable Bayesian double machine learning framework for high dimensional causal estimation, with application to racial disproportionality assessment”  by Yu Luo, Vanessa McNealis, and Yijing Li (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07695). 

Each folder contains the code for 

+	Neyman_EL_Ex1: Functions to implement MCMC using Algorithm 2 with K = 2 using Bayesian EL method for Example 1; 
+	Neyman_ETEL_Ex1: Functions to implement MCMC using Algorithm 2 with K = 2 using Bayesian ETEL method for Example 1;
+	Neyman_HD_Ex1: Functions to implement MCMC using Algorithm 2 with K = 2 using Bayesian HD method for Example 1;
+	runEx1: Simulation runs for n = 50, 200 with 1000 replications.
